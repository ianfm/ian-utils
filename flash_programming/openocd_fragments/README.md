# UNDER DEVELOPMENT

Right now this directory contains fragments of useful openocd config files and some GDB config files.

They are poorly tested and I know at least that using `do_flash` without `do_erase` doesn't work. 

In any event, they are here for reference and divided into logical chunks that can be inserted in other working openocd scripts.
